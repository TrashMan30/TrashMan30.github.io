            <h3><b>Cats</b></h3>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]
                
                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]
                
                Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC.[12][13] As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.[16][17][18] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[19]</p>

            <h3><b>Dogs</b></h3>
            <p>The dog or domestic dog, (Canis lupus familiaris[4] or Canis familiaris[5] to distinguish from other members of the Canis family), is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1]

                Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11] Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[12]
                
                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[13] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."</p>

            Taking swapnil chan senpai kawaii desu as an example, he is smol but is he too smol? Thats the question researchers at Harvard University tried to answer after years of study.The conclusion, they have reached is summarized below.
            <summary> The Smol Man experiment</summary>
            <p>
                <i>
                    On a testing period of 3 years, a batch of 5 swapnils have been created from the strands from the Omega swapnil. The omega swapnil is first of his kind and has been used as reference point.
                    <br> <b>Growing conditions that were kept constant in this experiment</b>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>

                </i>

            <p>
                <h4>Methods</h4>
                A sample of swapnil dna is imprinted into a human fetus through the method of [redacted]. They were then kept in a [redacted] chamber, where they were allowed to grow up. These chambers had a different flow of time for the experiments to be completed in 3 years. The behaviours of swapnil-01 were noted down each day.
                These were then, analysed by a professional, and conclusions were drawn at the end of the study.

            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4> 
                Swapnil was smol but not too smol to be hunted for game.
